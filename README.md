# Museful-Final_Project

Concept:
   Our goal is to build a learning environment which is not fixed for specific topics. Users can add selfgenerated content instead of just getting it. Users could decide about consuming or editing, adding and storing content.
    Our targeted audience are people from the age of 9-99 with focus of the young people!

Guideline:
  Playing is the key to learn. User is able to decide about which module to choose. Open source based developing.

MUSEFUL is a cross-plattform MERNstack application to learn, search for, create and collect content – in a musefully and playful way. In the one hand this CRUD grounded fullstack project gets for example the vocabulary learning component words from APIs like Datamuse, Wordnik or Oxford Dictionary. On the other hand this application could be used to create and store user-generated list.
